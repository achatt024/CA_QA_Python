# Imagine you're developing a health advisory system.
# In this Python exercise, you will work with nested conditions
# to provide personalized advice based on a person's health condition.

# Here's what you need to do:
# Create a variable named 'is_sick' and set it to True.
# Create a variable named 'sickness' and assign the value 'fever'.

# Now, implement the following nested conditions:

# - If someone is sick:
#   - If someone has a fever, print the message 'Stay in bed!'
#   - If someone has a headache, print the message 'Take a painkiller!'
#   - If someone has some other symptoms, use an 'else' statement to print 'Get some rest!'
# - If someone is not sick:
#   - Use an 'else' statement to print the message 'Work is waiting for you!'
