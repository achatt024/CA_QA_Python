# You're creating a program to determine eligibility for a discount.
# Here's what you need to do:

# 1. Create a variable named 'age' and assign an integer value to
# represent a person's age.
# 2. Create a variable named 'income' and assign an integer value
# to represent a person's monthly income.

# Now, apply the following conditions and print messages accordingly:

# If the person is both 18 years or older and has an income of $1000
# or less, print 'You qualify for the discount!'
# If the person is less than 18 years or has an income of $0,
# print 'You get a special discount!'
# If the person is neither qualified for the first nor the second
# discount, print 'Sorry, you are not eligible for any discount.'

# Remember to use the and, or, and not operators to combine conditions as needed.
